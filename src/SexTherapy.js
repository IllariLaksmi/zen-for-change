        Our sexuality is an essential part of our whole being, our objective is
        to help you live and enjoy your sexuality to the fullest. Sex Therapy is
        the process of exploring emotional, mental, physical and spiritual
        blockages that interfere with our sexual lives. This is process is done
        through the use of “talk therapy” by incorporating different modalities
        of sex therapy that will be tailored to your needs as an individual,
        couple or other relationship. We are a kink and polyamor friendly
        practice.
