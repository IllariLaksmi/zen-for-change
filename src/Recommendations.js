She is a very professional person. I had a problem trusting people, I was very mistreated by my family. I came to the United States with trauma that was not only caused by my family but also by what I went through along the way; it was something very difficult. Estefanía was always very positive and helped me to get out of the darkness in which I found myself living. Estefanía is the best counselor I have ever had.<span class="iconify" data-icon="bx:bxs-quote-alt-right" data-inline="false"></span></p>
