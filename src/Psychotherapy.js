      <p>
        We all are born with an innate capacity to develop happy and healthy
        lives. However, sometimes life experiences such as pain and trauma can
        interfere with our healthy development. As a result we may become
        unhappy or unsatisfied with our lives and adopt self-defeating thinking
        and behavioral patterns. Therapy is the process of examining, and
        exploring one’s self to develop new thinking patterns to cope with
        life’s challenges. We will assist you in identifying new coping
        mechanisms to find your own formula to achieve life balance.{" "}
