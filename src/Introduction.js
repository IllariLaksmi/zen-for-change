            <h1>Welcome to Zen for Change, a private practice in Fells Point-Baltimore</h1>
            <p>We are a mental health and sex therapy practice with a special focus on trauma, culture and sexuality. 
Finding a place we can trust to tell our stories is essential to finding a path to healing, recovery, and transformation. 
We all are born with an innate capacity to develop happy and healthy lives. However, sometimes life experiences such as hurts, and traumas can interfere. We may become unhappy or unsatisfied with our lives and adopt self-defeating thinking and behavioral patterns.

 We are here to assist you with your needs and collaboratively work to achieve your goals towards your well-being.</p>
